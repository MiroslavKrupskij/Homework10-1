     Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Recognized for her songwriting, musical versatility, artistic reinventions, and influence on the music industry, she is a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century. Swift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. Under Big Machine, she released six studio albums, four of them to country radio, starting with her self-titled album in 2006. Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to prominence. Speak Now (2010) incorporated rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She forwent her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do". Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians, the most-streamed female artist on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums with first-week sales of over one million copies in the US. She has been featured in listicles such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's "Greatest of All Time Artists", the Time 100, and Forbes Celebrity 100. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 29 Billboard Music Awards, 23 MTV Video Music Awards, three IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year wins, and 101 Guinness World Records. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment

     The Eras Tour is the ongoing sixth concert tour by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who described it as a journey through all of her musical "eras".[1] An homage to her albums, the Eras Tour is her most expansive tour yet, with 146 dates across five continents.[2] It is her second all-stadium tour after the 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour. Announced after the release of her tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), the Eras Tour commenced on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, United States, and is set to conclude on November 23, 2024, in Toronto, Canada. The show spans over three hours, with a set list of 44 songs divided into 10 distinct acts that portray the albums conceptually. It received unanimous acclaim from critics, who emphasized its concept, production, aesthetics and immersive ambience, as well as Swift's musicianship, vocals, stamina, and versatility. The tour had a cultural, economic and political impact, evident in form of unprecedented demand, ticket sales, and venue records worldwide, technical obstacles leading to imposition of price regulation and anti-scalping laws, elevated economies, businesses, and tourism, domination of news cycles and social media, and tributes from governments and organizations. Ticketmaster, an official partner, was scrutinized for ineffective sales and alleged monopoly. Swift announced and released various works during the tour: extended editions of Midnights, the re-recorded albums Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), the music videos for "Karma" and "I Can See You", and "Cruel Summer" as a single. An accompanying concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, is set for theatrical release in North America on October 13, 2023.
